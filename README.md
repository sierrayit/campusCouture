	Criteria:
		Creativity - Similar version already exists, but without a crowdsourcing or karma element to it. Does not incorporate any type of deposit - collects credit card information so you are charged either way. 
		Technical Difficulty - Requires storage of dresses in some type of database? Full stack website, maybe a search algorithm 
		Polish - Could be very polished/visually pleasing. 
		Usefulness - Solves the problem of having multiple dresses that you use only once, and that wouldnâ€™t be profitable to resell
